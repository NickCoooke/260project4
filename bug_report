This is a commit specific bug report and design decision writeup

Leave off note:
1) work on restructuring bst. This needs to be called after insertions and deletions.
    -find an algorithm for the restructure process!!!! save yourself time
2) how are we going to intigrate the key into upper level functions?? asking the user
    for a url is crazy talk... search by topic and then search individual?
3) UI isnt started.


Design Decisions. 
1) creating the key. THe key needed to be a unique value for each 
    Site. IN the prompt it asked for the searchable information from
    a website url, but upon further inspection I found that domains
    use various methods of storing that searchable data 
    (youtube just encrpyts it). 
        - key = topic + url --> this makes it unique for each element
                                and sorts tree by topic
