This is a commit specific bug report and design decision writeup

Leave off note:
So. Imported height and created Node::balance. Now I a working on the algorithm
to go throughout the tree and balance it. 

Design Decisions. 
1) creating the key. THe key needed to be a unique value for each 
    Site. IN the prompt it asked for the searchable information from
    a website url, but upon further inspection I found that domains
    use various methods of storing that searchable data 
    (youtube just encrpyts it). 
        - key = topic + url --> this makes it unique for each element
                                and sorts tree by topic
